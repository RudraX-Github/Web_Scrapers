Summary:

Selenium-based web scraper designed to extract property data from the Marshall County property search website. It reads a list of parcel numbers from a CSV file, searches each parcel on the website, extracts property details, and saves the results to a CSV file. The script uses parallel processing with multiple browser instances for efficiency and includes human-like interaction delays to avoid detection.



Problem Statement :- 

Objective:- 
Automate the extraction of property tax data from the Marshall County Government website using a list of parcel numbers provided in a CSV file.

Challenges Addressed:

Manual data entry and navigation on the website is time-consuming and error-prone.
The website uses dynamic content and requires human-like interaction to avoid bot detection.
Large volume of parcel numbers demands efficient, parallelized scraping.
Data must be extracted in a structured format and saved incrementally to avoid memory overload.

Output
A CSV file named optimized_results.csv containing structured property data for each parcel number.
